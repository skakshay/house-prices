# house-prices
This repository is an effort to apply advanced regression techniques on [Ames housing dataset](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) to predict house prices based on 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. For more info head over to [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) of challenge. 
[House-nb.ipynb](https://github.com/skakshay/house-prices/blob/master/House-nb.ipynb) contains detailed data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering and application basic models like lasso, random forest, gradient boosting. 
[xgb.ipynb](https://github.com/skakshay/house-prices/blob/master/xgb.ipynb) takes pre-processed data from House-nb.ipynb and uses gradient boosting implementation of XGBoost with parameter tuning.
